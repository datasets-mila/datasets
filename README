In the quest to better manage datasets used at Mila, we have set aside a new volume with greater capacity to host your datasets (/network/datasets).
This volume will be managed, meaning that write access to the volume is reserved to dedicated personnel. We therefore ask you to declare any datasets
you feel you need through this form : https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3XyKpvMaIHV2MaDBbFIVJCCcWLpo2HTjkQ94f-ebMRpY97Q/viewform?usp=sf_link.
One form should be filled per needed dataset. Alternatively, you can also send a mail to helpdesk@mila.quebec who will ask you to fill in the form and
follow up on the process.

Amongst the objectives for this initiative are:

- Ensure immutability of given datasets
- Duplication management
- Provenance tracking
- Cleanup of doubtfully useful datasets
- More space for more datasets
- Tighter integration with batch scheduling tools and distribution throughout Mila accessible clusters.
